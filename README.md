# ETHLISBON Hackathon 2022 -- CREDOUGH 

This is the official ETHLISBON Hackathon 2022 submission for our project Credough ðŸŒˆ. 

## Project Description 

Credough oracle allows DeFi platforms to understand the real credit risk of profiles across their communities, by incorporating both traditional financial credit scores (web2) and web 3 scores.


## Features 

 we have used [ For deployment we decided to let an overall choice for the user to create his Forum in a multi-chain world of possibilities. We offer : 
- [Goerli](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x79fbae85d230fa05b117c102d8e1f808dedd7c67#code) 
- [CronosTestnet]() 
- [GnosisTesnet (sokol)]() 

Those deployments were done using Hardhat.  

## How it Works

1. Defi platforms benefit from Credough's API service which can be used with an oracle service such as IEXEC that we have implemented to
determine whether a user is creditworthy when borrowing on a DeFi lending protocol.
2. The user logs into their FICO score on C. 
3.  The FICO score and user PID data is sent directly to the smart contract stored and encrypted. 
4. Only the user connected with his wallet can retrieve then the information.
